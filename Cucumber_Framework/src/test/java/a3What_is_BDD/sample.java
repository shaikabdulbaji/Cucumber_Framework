	 * Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) :
	 * Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) is a software development methodology that
	   aims to bridge the communication gap between different stakeholders in the 
	   software development process, including developers, testers, business analysts,
	   and domain experts. BDD focuses on describing the desired behavior of a software
	   system in a way that is understandable and meaningful to non-technical stakeholders,
	   while also serving as a basis for automated testing.


	 * Cucumber Framework:
	 * Cucumber is a popular BDD tool that helps implement BDD principles in software
	   development. It allows stakeholders to collaboratively define and document the
	   expected behavior of a system using plain text specifications. These specifications
	   are written in a language called Gherkin, which is designed to be human-readable 
	   and easily understandable.
