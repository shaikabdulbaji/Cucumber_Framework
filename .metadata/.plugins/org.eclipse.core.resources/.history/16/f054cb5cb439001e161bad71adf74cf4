/*
 * @CucumberOptions(plugin= {"html:target/CucumberReport.html"})
   The above line is attached in Runner class to see then html report.
   html:target/CucumberReport.html --> This is the path where that report is stored.
   pretty --> It will give clear report.
   
   
 * features="src/main/java/b35Running_a_specific_feature_file_features/Login34.feature"
   features="src/main/java/b35Running_a_specific_feature_file_features/Register34.feature"
   If we want to run particular feature then we give the above line of particular feature path.
   
 * It will run except these tags scenarios
   tags="@all and not @dev and not @ignore and not @wip"
   
 * To test the "dryRun" first of all add one step in feature file and run "MyRunner" then
   put dryRun="true" you will see the difference.
   
 * Now a days in latest cucumber version the junk text was not coming in console, the main
   use of  monochrome=true is for cleaning junk text in console.
   
 * In this session we are integrating TestNG with Cucumber 
   while doing this we follow some points
   1. First we add dependency with name "Cucumber-TestNG"
   2. Then open MyRunner class and remove this tag@RunWith(Cucumber.class)
   3. And extend MyRunner with "AbstractTestNGTests"
