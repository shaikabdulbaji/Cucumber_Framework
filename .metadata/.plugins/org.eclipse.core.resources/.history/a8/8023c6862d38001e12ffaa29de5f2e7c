#After convertion to cucumber project we mostly not seen that yellow lines it was overcomed by "cucumber symbol".


#Suppose in any statement of "Given,When,Then,And" are not matched to stepdefinition file it gives error in feature file

#In two ways we can generate step definition file 
#1. By right click on feature file and click on run and click on cucumber feature, step definition steps will generate.
#2. Other way copy these all steps and paste in "Tidy Gherkin" application, step definition steps will generate.

# Background keyword is used for putting all the common steps under it.
