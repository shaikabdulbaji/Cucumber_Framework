	 * This session all about "Running Cucumber Tests using Maven"
	 * If we run normally by right clcik on "MyRunner" class and click on "JUnit"
	   it will run normally.
	 * If we want to run the project by maven go to project and right click on project
	   go to run as it will display some options related to maven, click on maven test
	   the tests will run, but in this case the tests will not run.
	   
	 * To run the tests by maven first of all we want to update the "surefire plugin"
	   in pom.xml file. In pom.xml file there is normal surefire plugin but we want
	   to udate it with new surefire plugin.
